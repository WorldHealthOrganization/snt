Defusing with `enquo()` or `enquos()` is only needed in more complex cases, for instance if you need to inspect or modify the expressions in some way.  * The `.data` pronoun is an object that represents the current slice of data. If you have a variable name in a string, use the `.data` pronoun to subset that variable with `[[`. * Another tidy eval operator is `:=`. It makes it possible to use glue and curly-curly syntax on the LHS of `=`. For technical reasons, the R language doesn't support complex expressions on the left of `=`, so we use `:=` as a workaround. * Many tidy eval functions like `dplyr::mutate()` or `dplyr::summarise()` give an automatic name to unnamed inputs. If you need to create the same sort of automatic names by yourself, use `as_label()`. For instance, the glue-tunnelling syntax above can be reproduced manually with: Expressions defused with `enquo()` (or tunnelled with `{{`) need not be simple column names, they can be arbitrarily complex. `as_label()` handles those cases gracefully. If your code assumes a simple column name, use `as_name()` instead. This is safer because it throws an error if the input is not a name as expected.
