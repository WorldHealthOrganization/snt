\description{
Central Configuration settings for SNT analysis.
This function could set the following configurations:
\enumerate{
\item the target subnational analysis country
\item folder structure
All the folder structure could be set separately,
however it will be nice if they are all under one root folder.
root
| --- output the status of data
| --- input
| ---
| --- graph the type of output
| --- report
| --- raster
\item postgresql db connection
}
}
